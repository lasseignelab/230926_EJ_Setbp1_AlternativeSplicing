Scripts for running STARsolo pipeline
Emma Jones - Updated Jan 29, 2024

Original snRNA-Seq data is from Whitlock et al., Cellular and Molecular Medicine 2023. Other informaton about the sequencing generation (age, nuclei extraction, and sequencing depth) is available from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcmm.18001

Raw sequencing data is available on GEO at acession GSE237816

To run STAR, please build a conda env using the environemnt.yml file in bin/conda

First you need to run 01_build_STAR_genome.sh
Expected file output for STAR genome: 25 GB

Next, you can run 02_run_STARsolo.sh for as many samples as you wish.
Expected file output for all 12 STARsolo outputs: 2TB

Most of the space making up the 2 TB is contained in the Aligned.out.sam files for each sample, which we do not use for downstream analyses. If desired, run STAR in a scratch space and move all files except the .sam to majorly cut down on space.

Sample information:

In our analyses, we have J and K samples. These letters and numbers were assigned by the sequencing core. J samples are brain samples and K samples are kidney. The numbers next to them represent the sample numbers. In our fastq files, this is tissue_number (output_dir) and then sample_id (fastq_prefix), e.g. J-1_S7. Each sample has 8 fastqfiles, as a product of 4 lanes with 2 reads each lane.

The following sample numbers apply to each sample:

Kidney

K1 - S1
K2 - S2
K3 - S3
K4 - S4
K5 - S5
K6 - S6

Brain

J1 - S7
J2 - S8
J3 - S9
J4 - S10
J13 - S11
J15 - S12

Example: sbatch run_STARsolo.sh J1 J-1_S7
