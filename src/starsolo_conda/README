Scripts for running STARsolo pipeline

Expected file output for STAR genome: 25 GB
Expected file output for STARsolo outputs: 2TB

Most of the space making up the 2 TB is contained in the Aligned.out.sam files for each sample, which we do not use for downstream analyses. If desired, run STAR in a scratch space and move all files except the .sam to majorly cut down on space.

Sample information:

In our analyses, we have J and K samples. J samples are brain samples and K samples are kidney. The numbers next to them represent the sample numbers. In our fastq files, this is tissue_number (output_dir) and then sample_id (fastq_prefix), e.g. J-1_S7. Each sample has 8 fastqfiles, as a product of 4 lanes with 2 reads each lane.

The following sample numbers apply to each sample:

Kidney

K1 - S1
K2 - S2
K3 - S3
K4 - S4
K5 - S5
K6 - S6

Brain

J1 - S7
J2 - S8
J3 - S9
J4 - S10
J13 - S11
J15 - S12

Example: sbatch run_STARsolo.sh J1 J-1_S7
