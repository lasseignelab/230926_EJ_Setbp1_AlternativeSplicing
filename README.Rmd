## Purpose 

The purpose of this project is to analyze cell-type specific patterns of alternative splicing in a rare neurodevelopmental disease model. 

## Scripts 

#### STARsolo

The following bash scripts are for running STARsolo on the raw fastq files. The J samples are all brain samples, while K samples are kidney. These scripts are not required to run if you download processed data from zenodo.

```{r echo = FALSE}
fs::dir_tree("src/starsolo_conda", recurse = FALSE, regexp = "*.sh")
```

* 01_build_STAR_genome.sh
* run_STARsolo_*

#### Seurat

The following scripts are for processing and filtering the gene expression data.

```{r echo = FALSE}
fs::dir_tree("src/seurat", recurse = FALSE)
```

* 01_import_filter_data.Rmd
* 02_annotate_cell_types.Rmd
* functions.R

#### MARVEL

The following scripts are for formatting and importing splice junction and expression data for MARVEL analyses.

```{r echo = FALSE}
fs::dir_tree("src/marvel", recurse = FALSE)
```

* 01_format_MARVEL_data.Rmd
* functions.R
